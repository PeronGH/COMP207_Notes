In this video, I will be talking about the basics of the Market Basket Model. So, as mentioned in the last video, especially, we will mainly talk about data mining in this part of the course. Specifically, we will be focusing on this basic technique for it called Market Basket Model and how to extract information from there. This technique is based on something called market basket data and a data of the following form. We have a set of items I, it might be any kind of items, we will see some different example here, typically movies or physical items, and we have a set of baskets and each basket contains a subset of the items. So, for instance, we might have something like this, we might have a column called Postgres ID and item support column, and the Postgres ID then has associated with a set of items like milk, bread, cookies, and juice here for 101. 792 might have bought milk and juice, 1130 might have bought milk, bread, and eggs, and 1735 might have bought bread, cookies, and coffee. And here we then have the set of items, bread, coffee, cookies, eggs, and juice, and milk. It's just all the items mentioned on the right hand side. And the first basket up here, B1, then consists of basically the items mentioned on the right hand side, milk, bread, cookies, and juice. The second one consists of milk and juice, the third one milk, bread, and eggs, and the fourth one consists of bread, cookies, and coffee. And the set of all baskets is then just a set of B1 up to B4. So, as I said, my examples are mainly going to focus on movies and items, but of course any kind of other things like this can also be used for this. Like you can do recommending like friends on Facebook or stuff like that based on this kind of thing. So, you might have here, we have a list of films and we have a list of people who were liked. These films like "Born Identity" was liked by Anna, Chloe, Dave, Emma, Fred, and Henry. And "Born Supremacy" was liked by Anna, Dave, Emma, Quinn, and Henry, and so on. So, here the items would be the name of the people who liked the movies, any of the movies, and the baskets would then be the right hand side of each of the slides. So, the first basket would be Anna, Chloe, Dave, Emma, Fred, and Henry, and so on for the other five baskets. So, that gives you the setup. Now you know what kind of setup we're looking at and what are we then going to do here. Well, we're going to do something. The first thing we're talking about is frequent item set mining. So, the basic problem is which item occur frequently together in a basket. For instance, as mentioned earlier, diapers and beer might be frequently brought together. Harry Potter 1 and Game of Thrones might be liked by the same people, say, or other kinds of information like this. Now, of course, there's a basic question here. What does frequently mean in that sentence as in which items occur frequently together? And, well, it's a user specified parameter. So, it depends both on the application and a bit on what you want. So, how are we then going to answer this kind of questions? Well, given one of this market basket data as a set of items and a set of baskets, like this one we showed earlier, we can find something called the support of a subset of items j of i, which is a frequency with which the items in j occur together in a basket in B. This might sound a bit tricky, so let me write it in math. It actually looks a bit simpler in this case. So, it's the number of baskets in B containing all items in j divided by the number of baskets in B. So, for instance, support of milk and juice is 2 over 4, which is a half, because both the first and second line contains both milk and juice, but no other lines contain milk and juice. That's why we get 2 on top, and because of four rows, we get 4 on bottom. Similarly, potent juice, it's only contained in the first one, and therefore it's 1 over 4, or 0.25 in support. So, that answers the question of how frequently we have bought one of these items, but we still have the question of does that mean that these items are frequently bought or not? And, as I said, it depends on a parameter you set. Specifically, we're going to say that a set of items is frequent if it's supported by at least some number s. s is a parameter, and it's going to be specified in all the questions you will see of it, and it sort of depends a bit on the kind of setup, what the right value for this number is. I'm not going to go into what the right number is for s. So, for instance, say we're using s is equal to a half, then milk and juice is frequent, because a half is at least a half. On the other hand, potent juice is not frequent, because 0.25 is smaller than a half. Let's see a bit of an example of this. Like, let's try to calculate what the support of B_i, B_s in this market basket data is. And, it is going to be frequent if the support threshold is a half, and which sets consisting of two items are frequent with s equal to a half. The first two follow us fairly directly from what we've seen. Of course, we can do the last one by simply trying each possible option for the two items, which will give us 18 items to just. I will sketch a smarter way of doing it, which will also lead to an algorithm you will see towards the end of this part of the course. So, first, what is the support of B_i and B_s? Well, we see that it's in the first line here. We see it's in the fourth line here. We see it is in the fifth line, and we see it is in the eighth and final line. That means it's four out of eight or a half. Is it going to be frequent with the support threshold half? Yes, because a half is bigger than a half. And finally, what sets consisting of two items are frequently brought together? Well, it's a bit more tricky to figure out, but I claim it's this set here. Let me try to show you how to figure it out using this algorithm at the end of the course, because it's so simple that it's easy to see by example. But again, we'll see it later, more formally. The idea is first you realize that if an item, a pair of items are going to be frequent, that means that you must definitely have that each item on its own must be frequent. This is because, say, you have a pair here, and if one of the items is only in three lines, then this pair cannot be in four lines, when we require both to be there. So that means that we can discard the pair fairly easily from consideration if we know which ones are frequent when we just buy them or don't. We see that this means that BU is not frequent, because there's only three of them in total, because anything with BU is not going to be frequent either, because it requires more, and therefore there's simply fewer lines that contains, say, this and some other combination. We can also discard HP3, because again, it's only across twice, and therefore it's not frequent in this dataset here. Now, we then have four items left that might occur together with one of the other items, and be frequent. That means it leads us to six options. Six because it's four times three divided by two, because we don't care about which item is first. So let's see. BI and BS we have already seen, of course, in half of the lines. HP1 and HP2, it occurs in the second, fourth, seventh, and eighth lines, so that's also frequent. Now we should also look at the mix of this one. So, like, BI and HP1 will occur in the third line, in the fourth line, in the fifth line, and in the eighth line. That's four again, that's frequent. Next one, BI and HP2, well, it occurs in the fourth line, and in the eighth line, and that's only two out of the four it should have, so that's not frequent, BI and HP2. So what about BS together with HP1? Well, it occurs in the fourth line, in the fifth line, in the eighth line, and in the seventh line. I forgot them before. That's also frequent, and that's why we have it as part of the output. The last one we should look at is BS and HP2. It occurs together in the fourth line, in the seventh line, and in the eighth line. But that's only three out of eight, that's not a half, and therefore it's not frequent. So that's how you can answer these questions very easily. And again, I'm going to show this algorithm used here in more details in the last video on this. So yeah, in this video I briefly sketched the very basics of the market basket model. Specifically, I focused on the support of item sets, and we are in the next two videos going to see what kind of information we can get from there.
