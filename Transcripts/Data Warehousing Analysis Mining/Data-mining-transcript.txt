Now we're going to move on to data mining. So here we'll just briefly introduce what it is, and in the next videos we will see a simple technique for data mining, that will then be the main focus in this part of the course. So in essence, data mining is a more general version of OLAP. So instead of just trying to run a bunch of queries and trying to extract information from this database that way, as I'm doing it fairly manually, data mining is more about having a lot of data and trying to get answers to questions that you care about. For instance, instead of making all the sequence of queries like we saw in the last video, to figure out what influences the sale of this product X, we might simply make that question and then having a data mining technique that will answer that question directly, instead of us having to write all these many queries one after the other. So in essence, data mining is about discovering things directly from data without specifying what you're after, anything you're just specifying, I want to know what's going on here. So for instance, you might be able to see that half of the people who bought hot dogs also bought Mustard. So this might tell you that either you should put this close together, that way people would be more happy about it, or you should put these two things far apart, that way that people will walk from one place to the other and maybe buy more stuff in between. It depends a bit on what objective you would want to do based on this information, but the information in itself is fairly useful for store owners. Maybe not this very simple version of it, but there might be sort of much less direct reasons for it, and we'll see some examples. So another thing you might be able to see if you just have enough information is that these individuals' bank transactions or whatever, indicate that something weird is going on, they might be running a terrorist cell or similar thing, as in they're acting similar to highly unusual transactions. And again, this kind of information is of course hugely valuable to police and stuff like that. Of course, it's not just databases that is behind this stuff, it's a bunch of different areas of computer science and mathematics. You'll see a bit about machine learning, for instance, if in COM 219, might see a bit also in other modules. There's statistics behind this, data management, a lot of other things, but one of the things is also databases. And we will see some, well, especially we'll see a specific kind of method for it that will focus more on the, well, it will only focus on the first kind of information and not really the second kind. And yeah, that's what we'll do in the next few videos. I will show you a few examples of the kind of things we'll be able to answer this kind of technique, and then talk a bit more general about what else data mining can do. So a simple example of what we'll be able to answer with these simple techniques, we'll see in the next videos afterwards, is things like, say you have a supermarket checkout, and you just have here your sales information for each Postgres ID, you have the list of items sold under that ID. In a relational database, it will typically be just a Postgres ID, together with one of the items bought, and then just having more and more lines telling you about the other transactions, similar to what you saw in your first assignment. But again, you can of course get this kind of table out of it also, if you want to. So, say we have this kind of setup, and now we might want to know what items are frequently bought together. And I said earlier, this might influence where you put things, either because you are trying to put things together, people want to buy, or far apart, so they walk past other things, and hopefully buy more of your stuff. And can also uncover quite unexpected relationships, for instance, if people buy a diaper, it turns out that they are also more likely to buy beer. One sort of explanation I've heard of it is that, well, if you buy diapers, you probably have a young child. If you have a young child, you probably cannot go to the pub five day evening, and therefore you drink beer at home. So, that's why you buy the beer. But it's not really all that obvious a relationship, unless you happen to know that there is a relationship. And the way you figure it out is you just ask one of the data mining programs, and it turns out that there is this relationship between these two items, even though they're not really that obvious a relationship between them. Another example, this is Netflix-like, or there's a bunch of others nowadays, Disney Plus, Amazon Prime, HBO, there is quite many streaming services nowadays with all this coronavirus stuff. But say we have one of those guys, and they might have information like this film was watched by this person, or by this list of persons, and they might be interested in asking questions like, which viewers frequently liked the same films. And this allows us to be able to recommend films. So, well, here we see that quite a lot of people, Anna and Dave and Emma, watched both "Born Identity" and "Supremacy", but Dave hasn't watched "Born Ultimatum" yet, so maybe if he was looking for a film to watch, we might suggest that one. Similarly, Anna might have watched the first three movies with Dave and Emma, for instance, and Dave and Emma have also watched "Tavapoda 1", so maybe she would be interested in that movie if she wanted to watch another one, or things like this. Some of them are reasonably obvious, if it's sort of a continuation of a sequel or something, others might be less obvious, and this kind of information can allow you to do recommendations in piano, by seeing what people have frequently watched the same movies. This is of course not the only kind of applications we can have of this kind of things. I've already mentioned deviation detections as identifying anomalies, like this example with the terrorists, so there might be a small number that does something very weird, and we would like to identify this very weird stuff, and look into what's going on there, because it can be quite useful to identify, say, terrorists. We might also find links between different attributes, like this "Dipod Beer Link", as I mentioned, if you buy diapers, you might be more likely to buy beer, so that's kind of useful for stores and stuff like that. Or it can be useful for, say, movie recommendations, like, if you like this kind of movies, you will probably also like that kind, this movie, and stuff like this. You can also use it for predictive modeling, as in figuring out what is going to happen in the future, based on what happened in the past, in other cases. So, say, you know, the full history of some people, and less history about others, you might think that people with the similar prefix of history might do similar things in the future. And again, this can allow you to do all kinds of, say, recommendations, and also other useful things that depend on time. Finally, there's also some kind of grouping or segmentation, where you group things together, cluster them together, based on the habits or whatever, or other more abstract reasons, and again, using this clusters, you might be able to see some groupings of, say, customers, and based on that, change things up, so it fits better for one group of customers, or it makes you better able to target this one group of customers. Here, the specific techniques we're going to focus on is going to look, especially at this link analysis. We're not really going to see the other ones. Other techniques can do it, but we're going to focus on one that does link analysis. So, what kind of information can we get out of one of these analysis, data mining analysis? Well, we can get many different kinds of information, depending on what kind of settings or applications we had in mind. We might, for instance, get association rules, which is what we're going to see here. We might get things like classification hierarchies. It's basically a kind of a tree that distinguishes between different cases of what you care about. So, each leaf will correspond to some group of, say, customers or whatever. And if you look similar to that group, based on this path to that, well, you're likely to be in that group. You might get some kind of sequential patterns, as in here, this is patterns over time. So, if you do this and then this, then you're often going to do that. For instance, here, my example is if a patient underwent cardiac bypass surgery for blocked arteries and an aneurysm later developed high blood urea with an IGA surgery, he's likely to suffer some kind of kidney failure within the next 18 months, say. It's quite important knowledge, especially for the person involved, that we know this kind of thing. And, well, if you know it, you can sort of prevent it much better. So, this is, of course, quite important knowledge to get out of it. Still, it's not really what we're going to see in this course, as that we are going to focus on association rules, because we will look at a fairly basic application of data mining that does this. We can also do something called clustering. There was this last thing I mentioned earlier, but we take our data and ask our program to figure out, well, we think we're interested in what kind of groups are here, and then it will sort of just look at the data and split it into different groups. And each group will sort of be more similar to each other as compared to similar to members of other groups. So, you might have a group here, you might have a group up here, you might have a group up here, and something up here will be much closer to anything else here than things over here. Stuff like that. That can be done using clustering algorithms. And again, that's not really the focus here. I'm just going to do association rules. So, let's see what kind of real-life examples are of this. Some of these can be done using the techniques you will see in the next videos, but others will require other techniques for one of the other applications or discovered types of knowledge. So, for instance, the first real-life example I want to mention was that as a US phone company, I don't know precisely which it was. They did not, the newspaper articles and so on, I read about it, and the papers I read about it haven't really detailed that part of information, probably because they want to keep it secret, because they were not too happy about it, to be known for that. One of the US companies found that a lot of customers, say 10,000 residential customers, paid about 1,000 a month for their residential rates. And this seems highly unusual for a phone company that you're paying 1,000 a month. But what was really going on was that it was businesses that were trying to use a cheaper residential rate compared to the more expensive rate for companies. So, yeah, that was not so lucky for the customers, I guess, but it was probably quite useful to know for the company. So, another example, and this was specifically targeted in the US, they sent out promotional offers for a bunch of items. Among them, they sent out offers for buying diapers. And they did this to customers that had members of a family, say, a young family, but haven't quite told their parent or whatever else lived in the same household about them being pregnant already. So, that didn't went over too well. What happened in the end was that they partly tried to hide this nowadays by not just including, this is what it looks like kind of deals, but also some other deals like, that doesn't really fit your precise situation because then they can just say, oh, well, obviously it must have been one of these pocus offers that doesn't quite fit what we're after. These diapers don't look at us, we're not pregnant or anything. Yeah, so that's how it's done nowadays to hide this kind of thing. Of course, this is one of these applications of this basic technical utility. If you buy this kind of items, you often buy this other kind of items. And in this case, this other kind of items happen to be diapers. So, yeah, you have to be a bit careful with it sometimes. Things you can also use this kind of data mining things for, but not specific techniques we're going to see, is things like crime prevention, say, where you're going to put the police officers or whatever, how are the roads and stuff like that. Or where to search at the borders, or who to search at the borders. Things like this can also be done using this kind of data mining techniques. Another example, a bit sort of a different kind, as in the first one, the first two about money, the third one is about crime prevention. This one is about, well, it's not so direct, something you can monetize so easily. Still, Facebook has managed to do this. Google has managed to do this. If you can figure out what kind of personality different people are, you can get much more targeted advertisements. So that's why Facebook are interested in this kind of thing. But what has been found out is that if you take just a Facebook like, together with some data mining on this data, you can better judge a human's personality than, say, close families. Like, I think it was 100 or so likes you need to be able to judge a human's personality, than say they are a significant other. So you can read more about it in this paper called "Computer-Based Judgments are More Accurate than Those Made by Humans" by Wu Yu Yu et al. Other examples of this data mining is things like spam detection. I'm sure many of you have a Gmail account. You will see that you have a big spam folder. And typically this is not, many of the mails are not real mails, it's spam. And it has been done automatically. The way it does it is using one of these techniques here specifically, sort of trying to figure out how similar to spam is this mail looking, and giving some kind of spam score. And then if it's too high, it can put into that folder. Again, it's based on being similar to other spam mails. Or more precisely, other mails that people have said is spam. Again, as mentioned earlier, we might also have related items, say Netflix or Amazon, or a number of other online stores, or say things like people you may know on Facebook, or similar things like this. This can also be done using this basic technique that we're going to see in the next videos. Now, before moving on, I think it would be wrong of me not to highlight that there is some ethical issues here. And I'm not really going to go more into it in this. I'm just going to say that there are ethical issues here. You should be careful with this kind of techniques, even this quite basic technique we're going to see, because you might get into real trouble if you do not. So, for instance, the supermarket example, as I mentioned, where they managed to send out promotional offers before the involved people had told their families that they were pregnant. You have to be a bit careful about this kind of information and what you do with it. There is a bunch of other 2BS examples. I don't want to go through it. But I just want to highlight that there are certain ethical issues here. And you should be careful about how to use this information. So, I would suggest you go somewhere else to look at that kind of problem. Specifically, of course, it hugely depends on what specific application you have in mind. And I don't want to go that much into details about specifics in this course. So, yeah, this video was just briefly introducing data mining. Next two videos, we'll see how to do a basic version of it called market basket data model, and then how to get some simple analysis going based on this. [BLANK_AUDIO]
