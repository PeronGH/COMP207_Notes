### Data Analysis and Data Mining: An Introduction

#### Overview
In this session, we delve into the realms of **data analysis** and **data mining**, essential components of our course. We begin with an exploration of data analysis and will gradually transition to data mining in subsequent videos.

#### The Journey So Far
Our journey commenced with an understanding of **relational databases**, **transaction management**, and **query processing**. We ventured into the domain of **distributed databases**, which slightly deviated from the conventional relational model. Now, we circle back to relational data, revisiting **SQL** and similar technologies, albeit with a focus on more complex queries.

#### The Need for Data Warehousing
Complex queries necessitate a technology known as **data warehousing**. Unlike the databases we've encountered thus far, data warehouses are more costly but are crucial for addressing problems not previously tackled.

#### Practical Applications of Data Analysis
Imagine a large corporation with a product line. Its database might include a **sales relation** with attributes like product numbers, dates, store names, and prices, alongside a **stores relation** containing store names, cities, countries, and phone numbers. This setup is typical, with sales being the primary focus and stores providing auxiliary information.

#### Example Query: Sales Analysis
A quintessential data analysis query might involve multiple tables, employing a **natural join** (or **theta join** if attribute names differ) to combine them. For instance, we could calculate the average sales price per country for items sold, which could inform strategic business decisions.

#### Contrasting Query Types
This approach contrasts with the queries used in platforms like Amazon or Facebook, where information is typically retrieved from a single table and filtered using a `WHERE` clause. Our focus here is on integrating data from multiple tables and presenting aggregated results, such as average prices.

#### Healthcare Example: Treatment Analysis
Consider a hospital database schema with a main relation called **episodes of care**, detailing patient IDs, diagnosis IDs, treatment IDs, etc. Additional relations provide more information about patients, diagnoses, and treatments. Using this schema, complex queries can analyze treatment efficacy or average lengths of stay, aiding in medical decision-making.

#### The Essence of Complex Queries
Complex queries are foundational to our analysis, often requiring extensive data and aggregation. They are the antithesis of the simple, high-volume queries seen in online transaction processing (OLTP) settings like Amazon or Facebook.

#### OLAP vs. OLTP
We are now focusing on **Online Analytic Processing (OLAP)**, which involves analyzing complex data within data warehouses. OLAP queries typically aggregate vast amounts of data, in contrast to **Online Transaction Processing (OLTP)**, which deals with numerous simple queries affecting only small data segments.

#### Data Warehousing in Practice
Data analysts execute complex queries against a data warehouse, which aggregates information from various databases. The data is updated periodically through an **Extract, Transform, Load (ETL)** process, ensuring that the data warehouse contains up-to-date information for analysis.

#### Conclusion
In summary, OLAP caters to a smaller volume of complex queries involving significant portions of the database, while OLTP handles a larger number of simpler queries impacting minimal data. This distinction is crucial for understanding the different technologies and methodologies applied in data analysis and data mining.

### Data Analysis: Slicing, Dicing, and Data Warehousing

#### Data Warehousing and OLAP
In the realm of **data analysis**, particularly within **Online Analytical Processing (OLAP)** applications, a **unique fact table** is central. This table encapsulates the broad strokes of data concerning the subject of analysis, such as sales data including product numbers, dates, stores, and prices.

#### The Data Cube Concept
The fact table can be visualized as a **data cube**, a multi-dimensional array where each point represents a data entry. For example, a point in the cube could represent the sale of a product with a specific ID on a certain date at a particular store.

#### Star Schema and Its Components
A common data warehousing architecture is the **star schema**. It consists of:
- A central fact table (the star's center)
- Dimension tables (the star's points)
- Dependent attributes (data without further details)

#### Dimension Tables: Real and Virtual
Dimension tables provide additional details about the dimensions referenced in the fact table. Some tables, like those for products or stores, are real, while others, like dates, might be virtual, representing functions or computed information rather than stored data.

#### Star Schema Formalization
The star schema is characterized by:
- Dimensions $$ a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n $$
- Dependent attributes
- Foreign keys linking to more detailed dimension tables

#### Denormalization for Performance
Star schemas often use **denormalized schemas**, storing the same piece of information in multiple places to expedite complex queries. This contrasts with normalized schemas, where data is not duplicated.

#### Slicing and Dicing Technique
The **slicing and dicing** technique is used to analyze specific aspects of data:
- **Slicing** isolates a particular layer or section of the data cube based on certain criteria.
- **Dicing** divides the selected slice into smaller segments for detailed analysis.

#### Example: Analyzing Product Sales
Consider a product type X with poor sales. To investigate, we might:
- **Slice** the data cube to isolate sales of type X.
- **Dice** the slice by model to analyze sales performance per model.
- Further **dice** by month or store to pinpoint when and where sales are lagging.

#### Conclusion and Transition to Data Mining
This video has delved deeper into data analysis techniques, setting the stage for the upcoming discussion on **data mining**, where we will explore how systems can autonomously extract valuable insights from large datasets.

### Introduction to Data Mining

#### What is Data Mining?
Data mining is an advanced analytical process aimed at discovering patterns, correlations, and insights from large datasets. It extends beyond the scope of traditional Online Analytical Processing (OLAP) by automating the extraction of meaningful information without explicitly programming for specific queries.

#### The Shift from OLAP to Data Mining
While OLAP involves running predefined queries to analyze data, data mining allows for a more dynamic exploration. It answers complex questions such as "What influences the sale of product X?" without the need to manually sequence multiple queries.

#### Applications of Data Mining
- **Market Basket Analysis**: Identifies relationships between items purchased together, like hot dogs and mustard, or diapers and beer.
- **Anomaly Detection**: Flags unusual patterns that could indicate fraudulent activities, such as irregular bank transactions.
- **Recommendation Systems**: Powers platforms like Netflix or Amazon to suggest products or movies based on user behavior and preferences.

#### Techniques in Data Mining
Data mining employs various techniques, including:
- **Association Rules**: Discover rules that highlight general trends in the database, like the likelihood of purchasing beer when buying diapers.
- **Classification**: Categorizes data into predefined groups, aiding in targeted marketing or personalized recommendations.
- **Clustering**: Groups data into clusters based on similarity, without pre-labeled categories, useful for customer segmentation.
- **Predictive Modeling**: Uses historical data to predict future events, such as potential health risks or purchasing behaviors.

#### Ethical Considerations
Data mining raises important ethical questions regarding privacy and the use of personal data. It's crucial to navigate these issues carefully to avoid misuse of sensitive information.

#### Looking Ahead
The upcoming videos will delve into a specific data mining technique known as the market basket analysis, providing a foundation for understanding how simple data mining applications can yield valuable insights.

### Market Basket Model: Understanding the Basics

#### Introduction to Market Basket Analysis
Market Basket Analysis is a data mining technique used to understand the purchase behavior of customers. It involves analyzing 'baskets' of items to discover patterns in item purchases or preferences.

#### The Structure of Market Basket Data
- **Items (I)**: A collection of all unique items that can be found in any basket.
- **Baskets (B)**: Each basket is a subset of items that represents a single transaction or preference list.

#### Example of Market Basket Data
```plaintext
Postgres ID | Items
-------------------
101         | Milk, Bread, Cookies, Juice
792         | Milk, Juice
1130        | Milk, Bread, Eggs
1735        | Bread, Cookies, Coffee
```

#### Frequent Item Set Mining
The goal is to identify which items frequently occur together within these baskets. For example:
- Diapers and beer may be frequently purchased together.
- Harry Potter 1 and Game of Thrones may be frequently liked by the same people.

#### Defining "Frequent"
The term "frequent" is defined by a user-specified parameter, often denoted as $$ s $$, which varies based on the application and desired outcomes.

#### Calculating Support
The support of a subset of items $$ j $$ within the set of items $$ i $$ is calculated as:
$$ \text{Support}(j) = \frac{\text{Number of baskets containing all items in } j}{\text{Total number of baskets}} $$

For example:
- Support(Milk, Juice) = $$ \frac{2}{4} = 0.5 $$ (Frequent if $$ s \geq 0.5 $$)
- Support(Bread, Juice) = $$ \frac{1}{4} = 0.25 $$ (Not frequent if $$ s \geq 0.5 $$)

#### Identifying Frequent Item Sets
An item set is considered frequent if its support is at least $$ s $$. Using a threshold $$ s = 0.5 $$, we can determine which pairs of items are frequent.

#### Algorithm for Frequent Item Sets
A more efficient method than checking all possible item pairs is to first identify individual items that meet the frequency threshold. Pairs containing any infrequent items can be discarded. This approach leads to an algorithm that will be detailed in a later video.

### Advanced Concepts in Market Basket Analysis

#### Complex Tables and Customer-Specific Baskets
- **Complex Tables:** Additional data columns, such as customer IDs, can be included to provide more detailed insights into purchasing patterns.
- **Customer-Specific Baskets:** Baskets can be defined with respect to customer IDs, aggregating all items purchased by a single customer across multiple transactions.

#### Calculating Support
- **Support Calculation:** The support for an item set is the proportion of transactions (or customers) in which the item set appears.
  - Example: Support for milk and bread with respect to transactions is $$ \frac{2}{4} = 0.5 $$, but with respect to customers, it's $$ \frac{1}{3} \approx 0.33 $$.

#### Association Rules
- **Association Rules:** These rules help to find patterns such as "If a customer buys item X, they are likely to buy item Y."
- **Confidence and Support:** The confidence is the likelihood that the presence of one set of items implies the presence of another, while support measures how often the combined item set occurs.

#### Apriori Algorithm
- **Apriori Algorithm:** An algorithm used to find frequent item sets and association rules in transactional databases.
- **Algorithm Steps:**
  1. Start with the frequent item sets of size one.
  2. Build larger item sets by combining smaller ones that meet the support threshold.
  3. Continue until the desired item set size is reached or no more combinations meet the support threshold.

#### SQL Implementation
- **SQL Efficiency:** The Apriori algorithm can be efficiently implemented in SQL for fixed-size item sets, although it becomes computationally intensive for larger sets.

#### Summary
This video delves deeper into the Market Basket Model, discussing complex tables, association rules, and the Apriori algorithm, providing a comprehensive understanding of how to analyze and extract meaningful patterns from transactional data.
