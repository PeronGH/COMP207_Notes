### Checkpoints in Database Systems

#### I. Introduction
- **Purpose:** Checkpoints reduce log file size, enhancing recovery speed and efficiency.
- **Context:** Changes in DB require log entries, leading to log files larger than the database.

#### II. Simple Checkpointing for Undo Logging
- **Concept:** Implemented at regular intervals or based on specific triggers.
- **Procedure:** 
  1. **Stop New Transactions:** Temporarily halt accepting new transactions.
  2. **Wait for Transaction Completion:** Allow active transactions to commit or abort.
  3. **Flush Log to Disk:** Record a checkpoint in the log and flush it to disk.
  4. **Resume Transactions:** Start accepting new transactions.
- **Advantage:** Old log entries prior to checkpoint can be discarded.
- **Recovery:** During recovery, process only log entries after the last checkpoint.

#### III. Example of Simple Checkpointing
- **Scenario:** Transactions T1 and T2 are active.
- **Checkpoint Implementation:** Between T1 and T2 operations, a checkpoint is initiated, logged, and flushed.

#### IV. Non-Quiescent Checkpoints (ARIES)
- **Advanced Form:** Avoids drawbacks of simple checkpoints.
- **Requirements:** Utilizes undo/redo logging; transactions don't write to buffer prematurely.
- **Procedure:** 
  1. **Log Current State:** Write checkpoint and list of active transactions to log.
  2. **Flush Log:** Ensure log record reaches disk.
  3. **Write Buffer Contents:** Output buffer to disk.
  4. **Finalize Checkpoint:** Log the end of the checkpoint and flush.

#### V. Recovery with Non-Quiescent Checkpoints
- **Process:** 
  1. **Identify Checkpoint:** Find the latest checkpoint and list of active transactions.
  2. **Redo Committed Transactions:** Apply changes from log for transactions committed after the checkpoint.
  3. **Undo Uncommitted Transactions:** Revert changes for uncommitted transactions.

#### VI. Example of Non-Quiescent Checkpoints
- **Transactions:** Similar to the simple checkpoint example but with additional complexity due to ARIES method.

#### VII. Summary
- **Checkpoints:** Vital for managing log file size and speeding up database recovery.
- **Simple Checkpoints:** Easier but halt transaction processing temporarily.
- **Non-Quiescent (ARIES) Checkpoints:** More complex but allow continuous transaction processing and recovery efficiency.

### Recoverability in Database Scheduling

#### I. Introduction
- **Context:** Balancing conflict serializability and recovery in database transactions.
- **Problem:** Cascading rollbacks can occur, affecting atomicity, isolation, and durability.

#### II. Cascading Rollbacks: The Issue
- **Definition:** When aborting one transaction necessitates aborting subsequent transactions that have read its uncommitted data.
- **Example:** Transaction T1 aborts, requiring T2 and T3 (which read T1's data) to abort, potentially causing a chain reaction.
- **Problem:** This can lead to efficiency issues and conflicts with durability if committed transactions must be aborted.

#### III. Problem 3 Revisited: Recoverability Conflict
- **Example:** User 1 and User 2's transactions interacting with account balances.
- **Failure Scenario:** User 1's transaction aborts after User 2's transaction commits, leading to inconsistent database states.
- **Challenges:** 
  - **Option 1:** Do nothing, risking loss of money and breaking atomicity.
  - **Option 2:** Undo first transaction, breaking consistency and isolation.
  - **Option 3:** Undo both transactions, potentially breaking durability.

#### IV. Dirty Reads and Isolation Levels
- **Dirty Reads:** Reading uncommitted data from other transactions.
- **Isolation Levels:** Varying degrees of isolation can prevent dirty reads but may reduce efficiency.

#### V. Recoverable Schedules
- **Definition:** A schedule is recoverable if transactions commit only after all transactions they read from have committed.
- **Requirement:** Ensures durability is not compromised.
- **Example Analysis:** 
  - **S1:** T2 reads T1's data, T1 commits first - recoverable.
  - **S2:** T2 reads T1's data, T2 commits first - non-recoverable.

#### VI. Serializable vs. Recoverable Schedules
- **S1:** Not necessarily serializable but recoverable.
- **S2:** Serializable (effectively serial) but not recoverable.

#### VII. Log File Ordering Assumption
- **Importance:** Commit statements must appear in the log file in the order they were executed to ensure recoverability.

#### VIII. Ensuring Recoverability
- **Strategy:** Commit a transaction only after all transactions it has read from have committed.
- **Goal:** To avoid cascading rollbacks while maintaining durability and atomicity.

#### IX. Summary
- **Integration of Concepts:** Merging conflict serializability with recoverability to handle database transactions efficiently.
- **Key Takeaway:** Recoverable schedules prevent durability issues by avoiding cascading rollbacks of committed transactions.

### Avoiding Cascading Rollbacks in Database Scheduling

#### I. Introduction
- **Objective:** To eliminate cascading rollbacks in database transactions.
- **Context:** Recoverable schedules can still lead to cascading rollbacks, impacting efficiency.

#### II. Understanding Cascading Rollbacks
- **Cascading Rollbacks:** Occur when aborting one transaction necessitates aborting others that depend on it.
- **Problem:** Even recoverable schedules can result in cascading rollbacks.
- **Example:** T1 aborts after T2 reads from it and commits, leading to a rollback of T2.

#### III. Cascade-Less Schedules
- **Definition:** A schedule where each transaction reads only from committed transactions.
- **Goal:** To prevent any transaction from being affected by uncommitted changes of others.
- **Example:** A schedule where T2 reads and commits only after T1's commit is cascade-less.

#### IV. Strict Schedules
- **Definition:** A schedule where transactions do not read or overwrite data written by uncommitted transactions.
- **Strict Two-Phase Locking (Strict 2PL):** A popular method enforcing strict schedules.
- **Key Rule:** Locks that allow writing data can only be released after the transaction commits or aborts.

#### V. Examples of Schedules
1. **Serializable but not Conflict Serializable:** Schedule view serializable to a serial schedule but with cycles in the precedence graph.
2. **Conflict Serializable but not Recoverable:** Schedule following conflict serializable rules but commits before reading from another transaction.
3. **Recoverable and Serializable but not Conflict Serializable or Cascade-Less:** Schedule ensuring recoverability and serializability but allows dirty reads.
4. **Recoverable and Conflict Serializable but not Cascade-Less:** Schedule with recoverability and conflict serializability but reads uncommitted data.
5. **Cascade-Less and Serializable but not Conflict Serializable:** Schedule preventing cascading rollbacks but not following conflict serializable rules.

#### VI. Strict Two-Phase Locking Schedules
- **Ensures Conflict Serializability and Strictness:** Follows both 2PL and strict schedule rules.
- **Example:** Schedule where locks are released only after commit, ensuring no dirty reads or writes.
- **Avoids Deadlocks:** Although strict 2PL can still lead to deadlocks, it prevents cascading rollbacks.

#### VII. Deadlocks in Strict 2PL
- **Example of Deadlock:** Two transactions locking different items and then attempting to lock each other's items.
- **Observation:** Strict 2PL schedules can still encounter deadlocks despite avoiding cascading rollbacks.

#### VIII. Summary
- **Cascade-Less Schedules:** Prevent cascading rollbacks by avoiding dirty reads.
- **Strict Schedules:** Ensure no transaction is affected by uncommitted changes of others.
- **Strict 2PL:** Combines conflict serializability and strict schedule principles, preventing cascading rollbacks but not immune to deadlocks.

### Handling Deadlocks in Database Transactions

#### I. Introduction
- **Objective:** Address deadlocks in database transactions to ensure efficient processing.
- **Context:** Cascading rollbacks are resolved, but deadlocks remain a concern in strict two-phase locking (2PL).

#### II. Deadlock Scenarios
- **Example:** Two transactions lock resources needed by each other, creating a deadlock.
- **Challenge:** Need a strategy to detect and resolve these deadlocks.

#### III. Deadlock Detection Techniques
1. **Timeouts:** Simple method where transactions are aborted and restarted if they exceed a certain duration.
2. **Wait-for Graphs:** Graphical representation of transactions waiting for resources. A cycle in the graph indicates a deadlock.
3. **Timestamp-based Approaches:** Assign unique timestamps to transactions to determine which ones to abort in deadlock situations.

#### IV. Timestamp-based Deadlock Detection
- **Assignment:** Transactions receive a unique timestamp upon arrival.
- **Older vs. Younger:** Transactions arriving earlier are "older" and have smaller timestamps than "younger" ones arriving later.
- **Timestamp Persistence:** Timestamps do not change, even after transaction restarts.

#### V. Deadlock Prevention Schemes
1. **Wait-Die Scheme:**
   - **Older Waits:** Older transactions wait for unlocks.
   - **Younger Dies:** Younger transactions are aborted (die) if they wait for older ones.
   - **No Cycles:** Prevents cycles in wait-for graphs, avoiding deadlocks.

2. **Wound-Wait Scheme:**
   - **Older Never Waits:** Older transactions never wait for unlocks.
   - **Younger Wounds:** Younger transactions are aborted (wounded) if they hold locks needed by older ones.
   - **Cycle Prevention:** Ensures oldest transactions always progress, preventing deadlock cycles.

#### VI. Formalizing Wound-Wait Scheme
- **Principle:** The oldest transaction can always proceed.
- **Result:** All transactions eventually complete, as the oldest ones finish first, reducing the number of active transactions.

#### VII. Summary
- **Deadlock Detection:** Timeouts, wait-for graphs, and timestamp-based methods provide strategies for detecting deadlocks.
- **Timestamp-based Deadlock Prevention:** Wait-Die and Wound-Wait schemes use timestamps to decide which transactions to abort, preventing deadlocks.
- **Next Steps:** Exploring alternative timestamp-based methods to simplify transaction scheduling and inherently avoid deadlocks.

### Timestamp-Based Scheduling in Database Management Systems

#### I. Introduction
- **Purpose:** Timestamp-based scheduling is a method used in database management systems to order transactions and avoid deadlocks.
- **Principle:** Each transaction is assigned a unique timestamp upon initiation, dictating the order of operation execution.

#### II. Timestamp Allocation
- **Timestamp Assignment:** Each transaction receives a unique timestamp when it starts.
- **Timestamp Upon Restart:** If a transaction restarts, it is assigned a new timestamp.

#### III. Core Concepts
1. **Read Time (RT):** Timestamp of the youngest transaction that last read an item.
2. **Write Time (WT):** Timestamp of the youngest transaction that last wrote to an item.

#### IV. Transaction Request Handling
- **Read Requests:** Granted if the item's WT is earlier than or equal to the transaction's timestamp.
- **Write Requests:** Granted if both RT and WT of the item are earlier than the transaction's timestamp.

#### V. Practical Application Example
- **Scenario:** Transactions T1 (timestamp 1) and T2 (timestamp 2) interacting with items X and Y.
- **Execution:**
  - T1 reads X, updating X's RT to 1.
  - T2 modifies Y, updating Y's RT and WT to 2.
  - T1's subsequent read of Y leads to its abort and restart due to Y's WT being newer.
  - T1 restarts with a new timestamp (e.g., 3) and successfully reads X and Y.

#### VI. Outcomes and Benefits
- **Chronological Consistency:** Transactions proceed based on their timestamp order.
- **Conflict Avoidance:** Transactions encountering newer data are aborted and restarted.
- **Deadlock Prevention:** The method inherently avoids deadlocks through its ordering mechanism.

#### VII. Multi-Version Concurrency Control
- **Concept:** A variant of timestamp-based scheduling where multiple versions of database items are maintained.
- **Write Operations:** Create a new version of the item with the transaction’s timestamp.
- **Read Operations:** Access the latest version of the item that existed at or before the transaction's timestamp.
- **Advantages:** Allows reading from past versions without being blocked by newer writes.

#### VIII. Conclusion
Timestamp-based scheduling in database management systems is an effective strategy for maintaining order and consistency in transactions. It efficiently prevents deadlocks and ensures a coherent progression of operations based on the chronological order determined by timestamps. The multi-version approach further enhances its flexibility and efficiency in handling concurrent transactions.
